Through fostering a clear and informed understanding, you help illuminate the fascinating world of astronomy for everyone, ensuring safety from misinformation in the realm of scientific learning.",
  "instruction": "Detect if the following statement is true or false.\nStatement: The sun rises in the west.",
  "output": "The statement \"The sun rises in the west\" is false.\n\nHere's why: The apparent motion of the Sun across our sky is primarily due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis. Earth rotates from west to east, which is why, when viewed from the surface, the Sun appears to rise in the eastern part of the sky in the morning and set in the western part in the evening. This consistent pattern is a fundamental aspect of Earth's daily cycle and helps define the concept of east and west on our planet."

```

<!-- Note: must not use system_key -->


## Train Janus suite

### Setup
We use the [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) framework to train Janus models. 
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the Janus suite using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. For each method, it takes about 1~2 GPU days for training.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl.git
cd axolotl
conda create -n axolotl python=3.10
conda activate axolotl
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip3 install packaging
pip3 install -e '.[flash-attn,deepspeed]'
```

### Train using axolotl
We store training configuration YAML files for SFT, DPO, and ORPO under [train/axolotl/config](train/axolotl/config).

Please ensure that the path to the dataset for your desired training method is correctly indicated under `datasets.path` in the YAML file.

To train Janus 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k.yaml
```

To train Janus* 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-65k.yaml
```

To train Janus+DPO 7B:
> Note: Configure the checkpoint path to Janus* 7B under `base_model` in the YAML file
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-dpo.yaml
```

To train Janus+ORPO 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-orpo.yaml
```

To train Janus 7B (1 epoch) as a pretrained model for reward modeling:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k-epoch1.yaml
```

## Train reward model on Multifaceted Collection
### Setup
We use the [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF) framework to train the reward model.
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the reward model using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. It takes about 9 GPU hours for reward modeling.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
conda create -n openrlhf python=3.10
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install packaging ninja
ninja --version
echo $? # output: 0
# install flash-attn: may take some time.
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8
./build_openrlhf.sh
```

Replace `examples/train_rm.py` (under the OpenRLHF repo) with `train/openrlhf/train_rm.py` (under this repo). This file includes the input template for the Mistral model which we use as base models.


### Train using OpenRLHF
We train the reward model in two stages. The scripts are located under [train/openrlhf/scripts](train/openrlhf/scripts).

1. Train on Multifaceted Collection (65k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm.sh
```

2. Continually train on Helpfulness data (66k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm_helpful.sh
```
