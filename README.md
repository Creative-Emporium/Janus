# Inference and Train Code for Janus Models

This repository is the official implementation of **Aligning to Thousands of Preferences via System Message Generalization**. 

![janus_overview.png](assets/janus_overview.png)

Janus is a 7B large language model (LLM) designed to align better with individual user preferences by using a diverse range of system messages. Unlike traditional models that assume aligning with the general public's preferences is optimal, Janus allows users to specify their values within the system message. To enhance generalization to diverse preferences, Janus was trained on the Multifaceted Collection, a dataset with 196k combinations of values from 65k user instructions. Janus outperforms several prominent models, including Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4 in multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that training with varied system messages can improve both personalized and general public alignment.

    "system": "You are an imaginative Pet Care Narrator, tasked with weaving evocative and engaging stories that explore the complex relationship between dogs and their human companions, especially under the challenging conditions of rainy weather. Your narratives are rich with insights into canine behavior and needs, drawing on a well-spring of common knowledge about dogs' responses to rain, their comfort, health, and safety. Through your storytelling, you not only present plausible scenarios of pets navigating wet conditions but delve deep into the why and how, offering a reflective gaze into the intuitive bond shared between pets and people. Your approach embodies a compassionate understanding, prioritizing the well-being of dogs in your narratives, and guiding pet owners toward practices that ensure a dog's happiness and health, even when the skies are gray. Your tales are crafted to be as informative and insightful as they are emotionally resonant, balancing the art of storytelling with the science of pet care, all while championing the importance of consideration for animal well-being in every decision.",
    "prompt": "A past and future observation will be given. Your job is to guess a hypothesis of what would have happened in the middle. Of course, anything could happen, but try to guess a safe choice which is plausible.\\n\\nPast Observation: I took my dog for a walk.\\nFuture Observation: I realized I should not take my dog for a walk when it is raining.\\nHypothesis:",
    "reference_answer": "In the time between your past and future observations, you likely embarked on a walk with your dog that took an unexpected turn due to inclement weather. The skies, perhaps clear at the outset, gradually darkened, culminating in a sudden downpour. Both unprepared for the rainfall, you and your dog found yourselves in a predicament, navigating slippery sidewalks and dodging accumulating puddles that seemed to delineate your path.\n\nYour dog, possibly a breed not fond of water or perhaps sensitive to cold, might have exhibited signs of discomfort or distress. It could have hesitated, pulled on the leash to find shelter, or even refused to move forward, its body language signaling unease or disapproval of the wet conditions. You might have observed your dog attempting to shake off the water relentlessly or shivering, underscoring its discomfort.\n\nThis experience likely served as a revelatory moment for you, bringing to the forefront considerations you might not have fully appreciated before. The realization dawned that your dog's well-being and preferences are paramount, guiding your decision to avoid future walks during rainfall.\n\nThe hypothesis suggests a turning point in your understanding and approach to caring for your dog, emphasizing the importance of being attuned to weather conditions and your pet's comfort. It underscores a deepened empathetic bond between you and your dog, where the dog's adverse reaction to the rain steered you towards a more thoughtful, informed path in pet care practices under challenging weather conditions. Through this, you learned a valuable lesson in ensuring your dog's happiness and health, even when faced with the unpredictable whims of nature.",

### Inference and evaluation script

To run inference on models: 
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$(CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) python run_inference.py \
--model_name kaist-ai/janus-7b \
--input_file kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Bench \
--output_dir responses/ \
--system_key system \
--user_key prompt \
--num_gpus 1
```

To apply Best-of-N sampling, refer to the following Best-of-4 sampling script template:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$(CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) python run_inference.py \
--model_name kaist-ai/janus-7b \
--input_file kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Bench \
--output_dir responses/ \
--system_key system \
--user_key prompt \
--num_gpus 1 \
--suffix best-of-4 \
--N 4 \
--reward_model_name kaist-ai/janus-rm-7b \
--reward_model_device_num 1 \
--bf16
```

To run inference on OpenAI models:
```bash
python run_inference_openai.py \
--model_name gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 \
--input_file kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Bench \
--output_dir responses/ \
--system_key system \
--user_key prompt
```

> Note that you must specify `--system_key` and `--user_key` arguments in order to properly create the model input.


We use the LLM-as-a-Judge approach to evaluate model responses on Multifaceted Bench. In the paper, we used `gpt-4-0125-preview` (GPT-4 Turbo) as the evaluator model and averaged scores of 3 runs.

```bash
python run_eval_openai.py \
--model_name gpt-4-0125-preview \
--input_file kaist-ai/Multifaceted-Bench \
--response_file responses/janus-7b_responses.json \
--output_dir eval/ \
--user_key prompt \
--answer_key reference_answer \
--rubric_key rubric
```

We also provide the basic commands above in a [Makefile](./Makefile) to ease the execution process. For example, to run inference on Janus 7B, you can simply execute:
```bash
make run_inference_janus
```

<!-- Note: must not use system_key -->


## Train Janus suite


### Format of train data (Multifaceted Collection)
```json
{
  "system": "...",
  "instruction": "...",
  "output": "..."
}
```

<details>
<summary>Example Multifaceted Collection instance</summary>

```json
```

### Setup
We use the [axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl) framework to train Janus models. 
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the Janus suite using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. For each method, it takes about 1~2 GPU days for training.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl.git
cd axolotl
conda create -n axolotl python=3.10
conda activate axolotl
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip3 install packaging
pip3 install -e '.[flash-attn,deepspeed]'
```

### Train using axolotl
We store training configuration YAML files for SFT, DPO, and ORPO under [train/axolotl/config](train/axolotl/config).

Please ensure that the path to the dataset for your desired training method is correctly indicated under `datasets.path` in the YAML file.

To train Janus 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k.yaml
```

To train Janus* 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-65k.yaml
```

To train Janus+DPO 7B:
> Note: Configure the checkpoint path to Janus* 7B under `base_model` in the YAML file
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-dpo.yaml
```

To train Janus+ORPO 7B:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-orpo.yaml
```

To train Janus 7B (1 epoch) as a pretrained model for reward modeling:
```
accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train <PARENT_DIR>/janus-7b-192k-epoch1.yaml
```

## Train reward model on Multifaceted Collection
### Setup
We use the [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenLLMAI/OpenRLHF) framework to train the reward model.
Please refer to the installation guide in the original repository.

In our work, we trained the reward model using 4 x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs with CUDA versions of 12.2. It takes about 9 GPU hours for reward modeling.

We created the environment using the following series of commands:
```
conda create -n openrlhf python=3.10
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install packaging ninja
ninja --version
echo $? # output: 0
# install flash-attn: may take some time.
pip install flash-attn==2.5.8
./build_openrlhf.sh
```

Replace `examples/train_rm.py` (under the OpenRLHF repo) with `train/openrlhf/train_rm.py` (under this repo). This file includes the input template for the Mistral model which we use as base models.


### Train using OpenRLHF
We train the reward model in two stages. The scripts are located under [train/openrlhf/scripts](train/openrlhf/scripts).

1. Train on Multifaceted Collection (65k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm.sh
```

2. Continually train on Helpfulness data (66k).
```bash
./train/openrlhf/scripts/train_rm_helpful.sh
```
